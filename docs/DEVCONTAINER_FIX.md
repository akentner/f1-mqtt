# DevContainer Troubleshooting

## Problem: DevContainer could not be started

### Solution

The DevContainer problem has been fixed. The original configuration had the following issues:

1. **Dockerfile Conflict**: The DevContainer used a production Dockerfile
2. **Dependencies Problem**: Wrong order when copying and installing
3. **ESLint Version Conflict**: Incompatible versions between ESLint 9 and TypeScript plugins

### What was changed:

#### DevContainer (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`)

- **Base Image**: Switch to `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:1-20-bullseye`
- **Dockerfile removed**: Now directly uses the Microsoft DevContainer image
- **Simplified Configuration**: Less complex setup steps

#### ESLint Configuration

- **Downgrade**: ESLint from v9 to v8.57.0 for compatibility
- **TypeScript Plugins**: Compatible versions installed
- **Simplified Config**: Prettier plugin temporarily removed

### Now working:

1. **Start DevContainer:**

   ```bash
   # In VS Code: Ctrl+Shift+P
   > Dev Containers: Reopen in Container
   ```

2. **Local Development:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev:watch  # ✅ Works
   npm run build     # ✅ Works
   npm test          # ✅ Works
   npm run lint      # ✅ Works
   ```

3. **Docker Development:**
   ```bash
   npm run docker:run  # ✅ Works
   ```

### Project Status: ✅ Fully functional
